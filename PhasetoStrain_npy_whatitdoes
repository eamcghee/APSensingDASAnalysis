#Read-in AP Sensing files, 5 minute files
#Set directory where you want to save the npy nanostrain files
#Set channel based on set gauge Length: e.g.: gauge length (GL) = 4.9005713 m, for channel 102, GL*channel is ~500m; channel 10 ~49m; channel 100 ~490m; channel 1000 ~4900m; 
#'res' is the raw DAS das in phase units; read-in, then convert phase to nanostrain with equation in code; RI was fixed by operator
#numpy arrays are saved as .npy and loaded in next code
